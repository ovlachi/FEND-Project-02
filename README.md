# Memory Game Project

## Introduction

This is  the second project of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program. Memory Game is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration) that I have built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## TheGame

The game board is made up of 16 cards appearing as a grid. Each of the cards will feature one of eight different symbols and cards are meant to be matched according to the symbols. The game begins with all cards presented symbol-side face down.
The player flips two cards over to reveal their underlying symbols. No kore than two cards can be turned over at a time.
If the two cards match they are bouncing once and stay opened. Their colour will be changed to green.
If the cards on't match they will turn back face down. 
The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.


## Technical

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).

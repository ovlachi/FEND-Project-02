# Memory Game Project

## Introduction

This is  the second project of Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program. Memory Game is a complete browser-based card matching game (also known as Concentration) that I have built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## How The Game Works

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the [Udacity Classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/me).
